# The Arena Project
The Arena Project is an online multiplayer FPS, currently in development by Synced Studios

## What is different about The Arena Project?
Players are getting bored of generic FPS shooters. As seen by recent hit games, players want unique content and game play.

The Arena Project is a based around a point system, where players compete in a number of rounds with different objectives. These objectives may contain things such as "kill competition", or interesting challenges like "the floor is lava". At the end of a round, points are added up depending on how well you did with the objective, and the player with the least points is eliminated. The remaining players move on to the next round.

## How do you play?
Players are equipped with two weapons, that can be fired and equipped using the left and right mouse buttons. The primary weapon is a generic gun, that can do some damage and weaken the enemy. The secondary weapon is a physics weapon, that can be used for fast transportation, moving objects, and damaging enemyâ€™s.


## Where can I play?
Currently, The Arena Project is still in development and is not available to play. Updates are consistantly being added, however we are in the early stages of development. This means that it may be some time until you can get your hands on this game.
